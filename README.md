# JavaEE_PCI_Requirements
This application was originally supplied to us to apply PCI requirements. 
Most requirements found were addressed with a coding solution although time constraints and homework requirements meant that not all could be addressed.  Some identified vulnerabilities that were not fixed include hard coded credentials, enforcing password complexity requirements, change of password every 90 days, not allowing the last 4 passwords, masking the PAN when displayed and unreadable when stored.
I do not have the original SQL file but it contained vulnerabilities that were addressed as well.
